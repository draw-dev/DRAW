Most of the posters were initially fans of hers, with a few claiming to know her personally. It was kind of hilarious and horrifying to read.\n\nThe thread started back in November with a poster (who is thought to be the woman herself) claiming this guy gets a girl pregnant, wants nothing to do with her but later wants the babies for vlog views and also goes around giving girls chlamydia.\n\nThe posts begin with feeling sorry for the woman, calling him a fuckboy, etc. She is a photographer with quite a few followers so people are checking on her social media for updates and also checking on this Hobbie guy. The day of her supposed labour, everyone starts asking questions. They notice the guy has deleted the baby scans from ig. Someone claiming to be a friend says she saw the woman at the hospital with the boy healthy but the girl in icu. The woman puts pictures of a baby boy on instastory and people begin debating on whether one baby died and the other lived. As the woman puts up more pictures but deletes them almost straight away, people are becoming suspicious - especially when her pictures show her to be in LA with a stroller and some other guy. Turns out, after some detective work, she stole these LA pictures from some other woman’s social media page and passed it off as her own (poster messaged the lady who’s pictures were being used and confirmed). More digging found the baby scans were also fake and taken from someone else.\n\nAt this point, people still think she was pregnant and gave birth to one child. Someone posts a youtube video of her with a baby bump doing a photoshoot with some photographer friends. One of these friends even took some artsy photos with her bump which he has now deleted from his Instagram. A number of posters are still trying to convince others that the woman is a victim and Hobbie is shady but it seems likely that this woman is posting under different names.\n\nIt isn’t until hobbie finally posts his ‘children don’t exist’ video that people realise the extent of this woman’s madness. According to her fans, she has previously admitted to suffering with bdp and probably has an obsession with this guy. Apparently, she’ll be making a response video.","mod_id36":"6g5vc","created_utc":1517802680.0,"subreddit":"MorbidReality","target_title":null,"target_permalink":"/r/MorbidReality/comments/7v35gy/youtuber_hobbie_stuart_catfished_by_woman_who/dtr5grm/","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/MorbidReality","details":"unspam","action":"approvecomment","target_author":"jjtr","target_fullname":"t1_dtr5grm","sr_id36":"2tz1e","id":"ModAction_d3a1090c-0a27-11e8-8d07-0e5190a2246e","mod":"XtremeCheese"}},{"kind":"modaction","data":{"description":null,"target_body":"I had a girlfriend try this shit once.\n\nRefused to show me the pregnancy test she supposedly took and kept dragging her feet about making a doctor's appointment.\n\nSo when I finally called and made a doctor's appointment on my own, she admitted she lied and I dropped the bitch like a hot rock.\n\n","mod_id36":"6g5vc","created_utc":1517799943.0,"subreddit":"MorbidReality","target_title":null,"target_permalink":"/r/MorbidReality/comments/7v35gy/youtuber_hobbie_stuart_catfished_by_woman_who/dtqimkq/","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/MorbidReality","details":"unspam","action":"approvecomment","target_author":"NeonDisease","target_fullname":"t1_dtqimkq","sr_id36":"2tz1e","id":"ModAction_74678232-0a21-11e8-837f-0ecc6dcea11c","mod":"XtremeCheese"}},{"kind":"modaction","data":{"description":null,"target_body":"http://reemwrites.blogspot.com/2012/02/photographer-amy-spanos-interview.html?m=1","mod_id36":"6g5vc","created_utc":1517799934.0,"subreddit":"MorbidReality","target_title":null,"target_permalink":"/r/MorbidReality/comments/7v35gy/youtuber_hobbie_stuart_catfished_by_woman_who/dtq2d45/","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/MorbidReality","details":"unspam","action":"approvecomment","target_author":"senorostrich","target_fullname":"t1_dtq2d45","sr_id36":"2tz1e","id":"ModAction_6ea6e680-0a21-11e8-96a6-0ede3f3f3618","mod":"XtremeCheese"}},{"kind":"modaction","data":{"description":null,"target_body":"IMO psychopathic and or mentally insane manipulation of someone and completely destroying their emotions and then disappearing into the ether is pretty dark.

I'm not trying to take the focus off of (unstable) kids having access to guns but I want to raise another issue.

I don't know if the Internet just highlights this but it's scary how many posts are on braincels and niceguys. Girls are scared of even rejecting these guys because of how they'll react.
