Well, before I get into this, I'm going to provide a (somewhat) short and (hopefully) useful little backstory for the sake of the uninitiated.\n\nSo for those of you that aren't aware, what I'm posting is something that took place on the board 4chan, and on 4chan there is a board called /r9k/. /r9k/ itself is an acronym for Robot9000, a name taken by the site's moderator Moot from the open-source chat moderation script developed in 2008 by Randall Munroe, and used to automoderate the /r9k/ board.\nDuring it's first implementation /r9k/ was arguably the most unique board 4chan had seen yet. The Robot9000 script made it so that users were unable to submit duplicate posts or duplicate images to the board, and each time you attempted to submit either text or graphics to the board that the robot detected as having already been submitted, you would be muted and barred from posting for a period of time, that multiplied x2 for each infraction incurred.\n\nThe original purpose of the board was to act as a kind of *slightly more* SFW version of /b/, but with more greentext and with the robot script overseeing everything in order to ensure all content was original, however it didn't take long for users to begun navigating methods to circumvent the robot. Users took to manipulating duplicated instances of text by ended them with the term \"bloxx\" (e.g. *\"THE HACKER KNOWN AS 4CHAN bloxx\"*), thus rendering it original text in the eyes of the robot, whereas image duplication was circumvented via opening images in paint and simply editing 1px before resubmitting.\n\nOn January 17th, 2011 Moot made the sudden decision to delete /r9k/ from the 4chan server entirely, as it was considered as no longer being able to serve its purpose. It was on November 10th, 2011 that the board was suddenly resurrected without warning, followed by the removal of the Robot9000 script altogether (although as far as I'm aware you still can't submit duplicate instances of text). Since then /r9k/ gradually morphed into a rather unusual place. The board no longer really has a purpose anymore, and though today you can find it playing host to incels, frogposters and other similarly angry young men, in the period between 2011 and late 2014 it was just a board where strange, lost individuals, both male and female, congregated, mostly just to talk, and mostly because they were lonely.\n\nBeing one of these strange, lost individuals myself, I'd actually been using /r9k/ myself since its incarnation in 2008, all the way up to 2016. It was on 9th April 2014 that this anonymous user first appeared, and I happened to be in the very first thread they posted to. From the first time she posted to r9k on Wed 09 Apr 2014, to the last (identifiable) post I could find of hers, made Sat 16 Jan 2016, she detailed absolutely horrifying tale of being kidnapped whilst travelling abroad in Italy, trafficked into Hungary and forced into sexual servitude, where she remained for 3 years, up until her rescue by Hungarian police in collaboration with Interpol. Each time she appeared in random threads and was asked to retell her story, not once was it found to be retconned nor revised. Each time it was told with the same level of accuracy as the time before, and more often than not expanded upon, and it was the intimate detail and sadness in which she communicated and composed herself in these threads that left me inclined to believe her story.\n\nWell, today my thoughts randomly drifted back towards this person, her story, and I decided to see if I could go and dig her old posts up out of the archives, and well, I found them. Given that this anonymous user's story never did end up becoming known to anybody outside a core sect of regular /r9k/ users, I realised that /r/morbidreality may well be perfect place to share this.\n\nI'll be compiling the relevant posts within each thread into a single PNG, and all of them into an independent album. Unfortunately sifting through each independent thread and screencapping the user's responses + the relevant responses if everybody communicating with her takes time, and so for now I'll be submitting and upload each capped thread piecemeal. For tonight I've completed the first thread, I'll probably do some more tomorrow, but I've also included the direct link to every thread I could find in which her story appeared, if you can be bothered sifting through them.\n\n- Album: https://imgur.com/a/0ROTF\n\n- Thread 01 Screencap: https://i.imgur.com/wP5sxwD.png\n\n- Thread 01 Archive Link: https://desuarchive.org/r9k/thread/11260886/#11261366\n\n- Thread 02 Archive Link: https://desuarchive.org/r9k/thread/13279443/#13280228\n\n- Thread 03 Archive Link: https://desuarchive.org/r9k/thread/13777145/#13779369\n\n- Thread 04 Archive Link: https://desuarchive.org/r9k/thread/14158212/#14159737\n\n- Thread 05 Archive Link: https://desuarchive.org/r9k/thread/15049448/#15052384\n\n- Thread 06 Archive Link: https://desuarchive.org/r9k/thread/15731199/#15731439\n\n- Thread 07 Archive Link: https://desuarchive.org/r9k/thread/16787163/#16791948\n\n- Thread 08 Archive Link: https://desuarchive.org/r9k/thread/25796166/#25798313","user_reports":[],"saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"Anonymous female(?) /r9k/ user details over 2 years worth of consistent posts a horrifying tale of being kidnapped whilst abroad, trafficked across borders, forced into sexual slavery, forced to give birth twice, before eventually being rescued by Interpol after 3 years of captivity","link_flair_richtext":[],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/MorbidReality","hidden":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"parent_whitelist_status":"promo_adult_nsfw","hide_score":false,"name":"t3_7yzjsf","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":242,"domain":"self.MorbidReality","media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":null,"can_mod_post":true,"score":242,"approved_by":null,"ignore_reports":false,"thumbnail":"default","edited":1519215409.0,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_css_class":null,"brand_safe":false,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1519189742.0,"link_flair_type":"text","banned_by":"Furrycheetah","author_flair_type":"text","contest_mode":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sounds like a sensationalist title huh?

From the first time she posted to r9k on Wed 09 Apr 2014, to the last (identifiable) post I could find of hers, made Sat 16 Jan 2016, she detailed absolutely horrifying tale of being kidnapped whilst travelling abroad in Italy, trafficked into Hungary and forced into sexual servitude, where she remained for 3 years, up until her rescue by Hungarian police in collaboration with Interpol. Each time she appeared in random threads and was asked to retell her story, not once was it found to be retconned nor revised. Each time it was told with the same level of accuracy as the time before, and more often than not expanded upon, and it was the intimate detail and sadness in which she communicated and composed herself in these threads that left me inclined to believe her story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, today my thoughts randomly drifted back towards this person, her story, and I decided to see if I could go and dig her old posts up out of the archives, and well, I found them. Given that this anonymous user&amp;#39;s story never did end up becoming known to anybody outside a core sect of regular /r9k/ users, I realised that &lt;a href=\"/r/morbidreality\"&gt;/r/morbidreality&lt;/a&gt; may well be perfect place to share this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll be compiling the relevant posts within each thread into a single PNG, and all of them into an independent album. Unfortunately sifting through each independent thread and screencapping the user&amp;#39;s responses + the relevant responses if everybody communicating with her takes time, and so for now I&amp;#39;ll be submitting and upload each capped thread piecemeal. For tonight I&amp;#39;ve completed the first thread, I&amp;#39;ll probably do some more tomorrow, but I&amp;#39;ve also included the direct link to every thread I could find in which her story appeared, if you can be bothered sifting through them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Album: &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/0ROTF\"&gt;https://imgur.com/a/0ROTF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thread 01 Screencap: &lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/wP5sxwD.png\"&gt;https://i.imgur.com/wP5sxwD.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thread 01 Archive Link: &lt;a href=\"https://desuarchive.org/r9k/thread/11260886/#11261366\"&gt;https://desuarchive.org/r9k/thread/11260886/#11261366&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thread 02 Archive Link: &lt;a href=\"https://desuarchive.org/r9k/thread/13279443/#13280228\"&gt;https://desuarchive.org/r9k/thread/13279443/#13280228&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thread 03 Archive Link: &lt;a href=\"https://desuarchive.org/r9k/thread/13777145/#13779369\"&gt;https://desuarchive.org/r9k/thread/13777145/#13779369&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thread 04 Archive Link: &lt;a href=\"https://desuarchive.org/r9k/thread/14158212/#14159737\"&gt;https://desuarchive.org/r9k/thread/14158212/#14159737&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thread 05 Archive Link: &lt;a href=\"https://desuarchive.org/r9k/thread/15049448/#15052384\"&gt;https://desuarchive.org/r9k/thread/15049448/#15052384&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thread 06 Archive Link: &lt;a href=\"https://desuarchive.org/r9k/thread/15731199/#15731439\"&gt;https://desuarchive.org/r9k/thread/15731199/#15731439&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thread 07 Archive Link: &lt;a href=\"https://desuarchive.org/r9k/thread/16787163/#16791948\"&gt;https://desuarchive.org/r9k/thread/16787163/#16791948&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thread 08 Archive Link: &lt;a href=\"https://desuarchive.org/r9k/thread/25796166/#25798313\"&gt;https://desuarchive.org/r9k/thread/25796166/#25798313&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":1519196497,"view_count":4235,"archived":false,"no_follow":false,"spam":false,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":true,"media":null,"can_gild":true,"removed":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"rte_mode":"markdown","visited":false,"num_reports":0,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2tz1e","mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"ban_note":"remove not spam","id":"7yzjsf","report_reasons":[],"author":"idlemoss","num_crossposts":0,"num_comments":19,"send_replies":true,"approved":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"/r/MorbidReality/comments/7yzjsf/anonymous_female_r9k_user_details_over_2_years/","whitelist_status":"promo_adult_nsfw","stickied":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MorbidReality/comments/7yzjsf/anonymous_female_r9k_user_details_over_2_years/","subreddit_subscribers":273429,"created_utc":1519160942.0,"mod_reports":[],"is_video":false}},{"kind":"t3","data":{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"MorbidReality","selftext":"I have been a member since before they stopped taking registrations, visited regularly.
