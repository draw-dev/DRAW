        "description": "Welcome to /r/MorbidReality, a subreddit devoted to the most disturbing content the internet has to offer. Here, we study and observe the darkest aspects of life and human nature.\n\nKeep in mind, a good post should foster insightful discussion by making you contemplate your humanity and life's struggles.\n\nIf you are unsure about how to conduct yourself in this subreddit, **a good rule of thumb to follow is to remain respectful and thoughtful at all times.**\n\n---\n\n#Rules\n\n*Make use of the downvote arrow and report button when encountering rule-breakers.*\n\n&gt;###Breaking any rule is grounds for an immediate ban.\n&gt;###The length of the ban is at the mod's discretion.\n\n#Commenting Rules\n\n1 - **Humor at the expense of someone's pain is strictly prohibited.** Refrain from posting jokes, memes, puns, reaction gifs and wordplays. Comments should contribute to **thoughtful and serious discussion only**.\n\n2 - **Refrain from promoting hate speech.**This includes but is not limited to; racism, sexism, religion-bashing, name-calling, insults, and any other abusive/threatening language. \"Abusive language\" includes posts which are malicious or insulting in nature. *Even if the person you are insulting committed a heinous act, do not describe how they should be punished if given the chance.* Keep it in /r/justiceporn.\n\n3 - Unless it is relevant to the discussion, **keep political discussions out of this sub.** Posting comments that are deemed to be baiting an argument, no matter what side of the fence it falls on, will be removed and the poster banned.\n\n#Submission Rules\n\n4 - **Please provide verification from a reliable source** for your submission. This is especially important with submissions that consist only of image(s) or video(s). **Posts that are fake/fiction will be removed**, even if they depict something that happens in real life.\n\n5 - **Submission titles must be descriptive and accurate enough to understand exactly what the content is inside.** Some people are particularly sensitive towards certain topics (e.g. animal abuse, torture) and would rather not look at it in the first place. This also helps prevent sensationalist and biased titles. Posts that have misleading titles will also be removed.\n\n6 - No submissions that rely **solely** on gore in order to be disturbing. We care about the story more often than the actual graphic content. The focus of this subreddit is to focus on personal struggle, **not just pictures of gore, dead bodies, and deformities**. If you want to submit or look at pictures without context behind them, there are many subreddits listed below that can cater to your needs.\n\n7 - This subreddit revolves around the morbidity of **human nature and human-related activities.** Therefore, your submission must have a direct correlation with people (e.g., a lion killing a zebra would not be allowed here. A human abusing an animal is allowed).\n\n8 - Check the new tab and search bar before you make a submission. **Reposts will be removed without warning**\n\n\nAll submissions are marked NSFW by default. If you ask why submissions are marked NSFW, you may be banned (since it's proof you never bothered reading the sidebar).\n\n--\n\n#General Information\n\n- Trying to cope with suicidal thoughts? Know a friend struggling with depression? /r/SuicideWatch and /r/SWResources provide counseling and hotline services that may be of use to you.\n\n- Text-based posts are for making requests, posting multiple links, or to engage morbid-related discussion. Want to make a post describing a morbid event you experienced? Consider posting to /r/trueoffmychest or /r/casualiama  instead.\n\n- **Don't downvote someone just because you disagree with their opinion.** Reserve your downvotes for the rule-breakers.\n\n---\n\n#Other Subreddits\n\nDidn't find what you were looking for on /r/MorbidReality?
