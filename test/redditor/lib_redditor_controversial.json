Alexis and I just returned from Washington, D.C. where we met with members and senators on both sides of the aisle and shared your &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/6mtgtp/we_need_your_voice_as_we_continue_the_fight_for/\"&gt;stories&lt;/a&gt; and passion about this issue.

We have a few more meetups planned this year, and so far it’s been great fun to connect with everyone face to face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reddit has &lt;a href=\"https://www.recode.net/2017/7/31/16037126/reddit-funding-200-million-valuation-steve-huffman-alexis-ohanian\"&gt;closed another round of funding&lt;/a&gt;. This is an important milestone for the company, and while Reddit the business continues to grow and is healthier than ever, the additional capital provides even more resources to build a Reddit that is accessible, welcoming, broad, and available to everyone on the planet. I want to emphasize our values and goals are not changing, and our investors continue to support our mission.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the product side, we have a lot going on. It’s incredible how much we’re building, and we’re excited to show you over the coming months. Our video beta continues to expand. A few hundred communities have access, and have been critical to working out bugs and polishing the system. We’re creating more &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6j3dkw/testing_geo_popular_your_local_frontpage_of_the/\"&gt;geo-specific&lt;/a&gt; views of Reddit, and the web redesign (codename: Reddit4) is well underway. I can’t wait for you all to see what we’re working on. The redesign is a massive effort and will take months to deploy. We&amp;#39;ll have an alpha end of August, a public beta in October, and we&amp;#39;ll see where the feedback takes us from there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We’re making some changes to our &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy\"&gt;Privacy Policy&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, we’re phasing out Do Not Track, which isn’t supported by all browsers, doesn’t work on mobile, and is implemented by few—if any—advertisers, and replacing it with our own &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/personalization\"&gt;privacy controls&lt;/a&gt;. DNT is a nice idea, but without buy-in from the entire ecosystem, its impact is limited. In place of DNT, we&amp;#39;re adding in new, more granular privacy controls that give you control over how Reddit uses any data we collect about you. This applies to data we collect both on and off Reddit  (some of which ad blockers don’t catch). The information we collect allows us to serve you both more relevant content and ads. While there is a tension between privacy and personalization, we will continue to be upfront with you about what we collect and give you mechanisms to opt out. Changes go into effect in 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our Community, Trust &amp;amp; Safety, and Anti-Evil teams are hitting their stride. For the first time ever, the majority of our enforcement actions last quarter were proactive instead of reactive. This means we’re catching abuse earlier, and as a result we saw over 1M fewer moderator reports despite traffic increasing over the same period (speaking of which, we updated &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6pxyvy/traffic_page_update_now_includes_data_from_all/\"&gt;community traffic&lt;/a&gt; numbers to be more accurate).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While there is plenty more to report, I’ll stop here.
